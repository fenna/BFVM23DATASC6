    "### Portfolio Assignment: Identifying Biomarkers for Pre-Eclampsia Using LC-MS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure, higher protein abundance in urine and signs of damage to other organs, often the liver or kidneys. The condition can lead to serious, even life-threatening complications for both the mother and baby if not properly managed. Pre-eclampsia is often detected at a late stage. Currently, the earliest diagnosis typically occurs around 20 weeks of pregnancy. Treatment options are limited, often involving early delivery of the baby or administering blood pressure-lowering medications.  Research has shown that taking a low dose of calcium and aspirin before 16 weeks of pregnancy can be effective, but administering this to healthy mothers is not ideal, since there could be side effects of the medicin. Therefore, there is an urgent need for earlier detection to enable more targeted and manageable treatments.\n",

    "Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has emerged as a highly effective technique for the sensitive detection, quantification, and identification of proteins and peptides in biological fluids, such as serum (Govorukhina, 2006). In the field of proteomics, LC-MS is widely used for the discovery of disease biomarkers\n",

    "#### Objective \n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze LC-MS abundance data in blood serum and identify potential biomarkers for pre-eclampsia in pregnant women. Additionally, you will investigate the relationship between these biomarkers and clinical data on the women's health status. This project aligns with ongoing research efforts at [HTRIC](https://htric.com/), which include developing a prognostic test for pre-eclampsia based on the maternal inflammatory response to paternal Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules expressed by the fetus. These molecules are key players in fetal rejection, a significant factor in pre-eclampsia.\n",

    "The dataset consists of blood serum samples collected from a total of 88 patients, with clinical data available, including age. There are multiple measurements for some patients, resulting in a total of 176 serum sample entries. The samples are categorized into 6 groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Individuals who have never been pregnant\n",
    "2. Currently healthy pregnant individuals\n",
    "serum samples\n",
    "3. Individuals who have been pregnant and are currently healthy postpartum after a normal pregnancy\n",
    "4. Cases of pre-eclampsia, divided into early-onset (EO) and late-onset pre-eclampsia (LOPE).\n",
    "5. Postpartum pre-eclampsia cases, with a clear distinction between the types\n",
    "6. Individuals who have experienced a normal pregnancy and are currently healthy postpartum but had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy\n",

    "You can choose from the following approaches or propose your own, as long as you justify your choices and support them with relevant literature when possible. You are encouraged to follow at least one approach, but comparing and evaluating multiple approaches is also an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing step: Missing Value Analysis**\n",
    "Imputation is necessary for addressing missing values, which may be due to measurements falling below the detection limit or difficulties in accurate quantification caused by poor cleavage efficiency. Before proceeding with imputation, thoroughly explore the missing values to identify any patterns. For example, stratify the data by group to assess the distribution of missing values and determine whether these are structurally consistent across groups. Additionally, calculate the percentage of missing values for each group. Determine the imputation strategy based on the exploration. Will you impute with a zero or with the median? Explain your strategies. It is important to report the specific proteins affected by missing values and clearly document the strategy you used to address this issue.\n",

    "##### Approach 1: Classic Method\n",
    "1. **Filtering Compounds:** Start by filtering out low-expressed compounds, referencing a stable compound like hemoglobin as a benchmark for high expression.\n",
    "2. **Clustering:** Apply a clustering algorithm using a Euclidean distance metric to group the filtered compounds.\n",
    "3. **Visualization:** Use a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to visualize the clusters. Color the data points based on relevant clinical data values to observe patterns.\n",
    "4. **Iteration:** Repeat the experiment, refining your clustering and filtering methods until the clusters align with the expected pregnancy profiles suggested by the clinical data. Use evaluation methods to access the performance of the clustering method.\n",
    "5. **Biomarker Identification:** Identify and report the most significant compounds (biomarkers) that define the meaningful clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approach 2: Alternative Method\n",
    "1. **Initial Filtering:** Apply initial filtering criteria to reduce noise and focus on compounds of interest. <<Specific filtering criteria can be chosen based on data characteristics.>>\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., PCA) to reduce the complexity of the data while retaining key information.\n",
    "3. **Clustering:** Cluster the resulting principal components to group similar pregnancy profiles.\n",
    "4. **Visualization:** Visualize the clusters using another dimensionality reduction method, coloring data points by clinical variables to interpret the clusters.\n",
    "5. **Iteration:** Refine your analysis, repeating as needed, to achieve clusters that best correspond to clinical pregnancy profiles. Use evaluation methods to access the performance of the clustering method.\n",
    "6. **Biomarker Identification:** Identify the most significant compounds in the clusters, interpreting them as potential biomarkers.\n",

    "- **Exploring Hybrid Methods:** Consider whether the results from unsupervised methods can be used as features in a supervised learning model. Ensure you justify your approach and provide supporting literature.\n",
    "- **Custom Analysis Path:** If you have a unique method or variation you’d like to explore, ensure it’s well-supported and clearly explained.\n",
