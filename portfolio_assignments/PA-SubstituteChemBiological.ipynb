    "## Portfolio assingment: Identifying Biological Substitutes for Synthetic Compounds Using Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: F.Feenstra\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to use unsupervised clustering techniques to identify biological compounds that could potentially serve as substitutes for synthetic chemicals. You will explore the use of chemical fingerprints, feature extraction, and clustering algorithms to find relationships between synthetic and natural compounds based on structural similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to the Problem**:\n",
    "   - Synthetic compounds are widely used in various industries, but there is a growing interest in finding biological alternatives due to environmental and health concerns.\n",
    "   - Your task is to use unsupervised clustering to identify potential biological substitutes for a given set of synthetic chemicals with specific functionalities (e.g., antimicrobial, antioxidant, or surfactant properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset**:\n",
    "   - You will be provided with two datasets:\n",
    "     - **Synthetic Compounds**: A list of synthetic chemicals with known structures.\n",
    "     - **Natural Compounds**: A database of natural products with biological activity.\n",
    "   - Both datasets will include chemical structures in the form of SMILES strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Load the datasets \n",
    "   - Use RDKit to generate chemical fingerprints for all compounds.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, calculate molecular descriptors if you prefer to use numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Choose an appropriate clustering algorithm \n",
    "   - Perform clustering on the feature representations of the compounds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Use t-SNE or UMAP to visualize the clustering results.\n",
    "   - Show how the synthetic and biological compounds are distributed accros the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Identify clusters that contain both synthetic and natural compounds.\n",
    "   - Discuss the potential of the natural compounds in these clusters as substitutes for the synthetic ones.\n",
    "   - Provide a brief explanation of how chemical similarity might indicate similar biological activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Discussion**:\n",
    "   - Reflect on the limitations of your approach, such as the choice of features or clustering method.\n",
