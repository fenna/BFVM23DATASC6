# Unsupervised Machine learning

## Introduction
Unsupervised machine learning focuses on uncovering hidden structures in datasets without relying on predefined labels. This repository includes exercises, portfolio assignments, and study cases designed to provide hands-on experience with these techniques.

### Key Concepts:
- **Clustering**: This technique identifies patterns or structures within data, allowing us to group data points into clusters based on similarities. 

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: This approach simplifies data by using structural characteristics to retain the most important information while reducing complexity. 

### Examples of Applications:
- Cell Type Annotation in PBMCs Using scRNA-Seq Data 
- Anomaly detection in sensor data
- Identifying Biological Substitutes for Synthetic Compounds 
- Identifying Biomarkers for Pre-Eclampsia Using LC-MS Data
- Cluster text to extract insights from clinical case reports
